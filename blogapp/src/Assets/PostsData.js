    description: `In academic publishing, a paper is an academic work that is usually published in an academic journal. It contains original research results or reviews existing results. Such a paper, also called an article, will only be considered valid if it undergoes a process of peer review by one or more referees (who are academics in the same field) who check that the content of the paper is suitable for publication in the journal. A paper may undergo a series of reviews, revisions, and re-submissions before finally being accepted or rejected for publication. This process typically takes several months. Next, there is often a delay of many months (or in some fields, over a year) before an accepted manuscript appears.[1] This is particularly true for the most popular journals where the number of accepted articles often outnumbers the space for printing. Due to this, many academics self-archive a 'preprint' or 'postprint' copy of their paper for free download from their personal or institutional website.`,

    description: `With a recent effort to reduce customer (engineers, not end users) pain on our container platform Titus, I started investigating “orphaned” pods. There are pods that never got to finish and had to be garbage collected with no real satisfactory final status. Our Service job (think ReplicatSet) owners don’t care too much, but our Batch users care a lot. Without a real return code, how can they know if it is safe to retry or not?When crafting mobile app interfaces, designers continually encounter the necessity to make decisions. There are numerous ways to convey the same information to users. At times, designers find it challenging to determine which element is most fitting for accomplishing their goals. For instance, how should the information be presented within a given scenario? Should it open on a new screen, a sheet or dialog, or maybe a snackbar? If a designer goes with a sheet, they face a new question — which closing mechanism to choose, a close button or a swipe gesture?
